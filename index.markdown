# About me

I am a Software Engineer.  I am very much interested in high performance applications.  I love analytics and data driven decision making.  I have solved a lot of interesting problems in the web.  Email me if you are interested in my work.

I love Astronomy.  I am part of San Jose Astronomical Association.  [Pinnacles west visitor center](https://osm.org/go/TYf2DuMgg--) is my favorite spot for star gazing.  I own an Orion 127mm Mak-Cas telescope.  This is my goto telescope.  I also have an 8'' dobsonian telescope.  I am still learning to effectively use my dobsonian telescopes.

I try to be active.  I like hiking.  We did Half dome last year.  That was the most difficult hike so far.  Looking forward to doing Mt. Whitney this year.
